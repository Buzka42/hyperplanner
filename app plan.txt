### FINAL ONE-SHOT ANTIGRAVITY PROMPT – COPY & PASTE THIS EXACTLY

Create a complete, production-ready, fully functional web app using React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components. Deploy it to Google Firebase Hosting + Firestore + Anonymous Authentication using the exact Firebase project below.

**USE THIS EXACT FIREBASE CONFIG – DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING:**

```js
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyBaVAyAt3GIKkZ_W6eOULq20s_g-KztsBo",
  authDomain: "workout-planner-b5bd6.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "workout-planner-b5bd6",
  storageBucket: "workout-planner-b5bd6.firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "93180527378",
  appId: "1:93180527378:web:f4b0c339dcef86766669cb"
};
```

Project is already created with:
- Firestore in test mode (allow read, write: if true;)
- Anonymous auth enabled
- Hosting ready

### App Name & Purpose
“Bench Domination” – a private, codeword-protected 12-week bench-press specialisation program with full auto-progression, AMRAP tracking, and future-proof architecture for adding more programs later.

### Entry System (First Screen)
- Single input field + big submit button
- User types any codeword → Enter
  - First time codeword → modal: “Choose your program” → only option right now: “12-Week Bench Domination”
  - Same codeword again → instantly opens that user’s saved program
  - Codeword “judziek” → opens full ADMIN PANEL (view/edit/delete any user, see all codewords, manually change 1RMs, etc.)

### Onboarding (Only Once)
Ask for these exact 1RMs (all paused, competition legal):
1. Paused Bench Press 1RM (kg or lbs – user chooses once)
2. Wide-Grip Bench Press 1RM
3. Spoto Press 1RM
4. Low Pin Press 1RM  
All weights in the entire program are calculated from these four numbers using the exact percentages below.

### Statistics Dashboard (Always Accessible via Sidebar)
- Current estimated 1RM for all four bench variations (updated every Saturday from AMRAP)
- Line graph of Paused Bench 1RM progression
- Sessions completed / Current week / Days remaining

### Exact 12-Week Program (DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING)

**Bench Days (Mon, Wed, Thu, Sat)**  
**Leg Days (Tue, Fri)** – Sunday always off

#### Monday – Heavy Strength
1. Paused Bench Press – 4 × 3  
   Weeks 1–4: 82.5% | 5–8: 85% | 9–12: 87.5–90% of current 1RM
2. Wide-Grip Bench Press – 3 × 6–8 @ 67.5% of regular bench 1RM
3. Behind-the-Neck Press – 4 × 5–8
4. Tricep Giant Set (0 rest between exercises, 2–3 min between giants)  
   5 paused BW dips → 12 rolling tricep extensions → 25 banded skullcrushers  
   Weeks 1–8: 2 giants | Weeks 9–12: 3 giants
5. Dragon Flags – 3 × failure (forced eccentrics, cheat concentric)

#### Wednesday – Volume Hypertrophy
1. Paused Bench Press – 4 × 8–10  
   Weeks 1–4: 72.5% | 5–8: 75% | 9–12: 77.5–80%
2. Spoto Press – 3 × 5 @ 72.5% of regular bench 1RM
3. Weighted Pull-ups – EMOM protocol (see table below)
4. Y-Raises (prone/cable) – 5 × 12–15 (weak side +2–3 extra reps)
5. Around-the-Worlds – 3 × 12–15

#### Thursday – Power / Speed
1. Paused Bench Press – 5 × 3–5 @ 77.5% (explosive)
2. Low Pin Press (pins at sticking point) – 2 × 4 @ 77.5%
3. Behind-the-Neck Press – 4 × 8–12
4. Same Tricep Giant Set as Monday
5. Dragon Flags – 3 × failure

#### Saturday – AMRAP Test Day (DRIVES ALL PROGRESSION)
1. Paused Bench Press  
   - 1st working set = AMRAP @ exactly 67.5% of current 1RM (fresh)  
   - Then 3 × 5 @ same weight (technique)
2. Wide-Grip Bench Press – 2 × 6 @ 62.5%
3. Weighted Pull-ups – same EMOM as Wednesday
4. Y-Raises & Around-the-Worlds same as Wednesday

**AMRAP Auto-Regulation Rule (execute instantly):**
- ≥8 reps → +10 lb / +4.5 kg next week on ALL bench working sets
- 5–7 reps → +5 lb / +2.5 kg
- ≤4 reps → hold weight; two consecutive ≤4 → auto 10% deload
- Recalculate estimated 1RM using Epley formula: weight × (1 + reps/30)

#### Tuesday & Friday – Legs (identical)
1. Walking Lunges – 3 × 10–15 each leg
2. Heels-Off Narrow Leg Press – 3 × 10–15
3. Reverse Nordic Curls – 2 × failure (1 weighted, 2 weighted + drop to BW)
4. Single-Leg Machine Hip Thrust – 3 × 10–15 each
5. Nordic Curls – 3 × failure
6. Hack Squat Calf Raises – 3 × 15–20
7. Hip Adduction – 2 × 8–12

Weeks 11–12 only – add intensity techniques:
- Lunges last set → rest-pause
- Leg press last set → triple drop
- Both Nordic variations → weighted + drop
- Hip thrusts & calves → 20-sec iso + partials

#### Weighted Pull-up 12-Week Plan (Wed + Sat)
Weeks 1–3: +smallest plate, max strict reps EMOM until form breaks  
Weeks 4–6: +20–30 lb, 3–5 reps EMOM × 12–15 min  
Weeks 7–9: Daily max triple + 4–6 back-off triples @ 85–90%  
Weeks 10–12: Test max weighted rep (week 10) → 3–5 × 2–3 @ 90–95%

### UI & Logging (Critical)
Every single set must show:
- Exercise name
- Target reps
- Pre-filled weight (rounded to nearest 2.5/5 lb or kg)
- Input boxes: actual reps + actual weight used
- Green check if hit target range / Red X if missed
- All data saved instantly to Firestore
- Calendar view with green/red days
- Dark mode, mobile-first, beautiful & fast

### Future-Proofing (MANDATORY)
Store the entire program as JSON in Firestore so new programs can be added later with zero code changes. All exercises, percentages, and rules must be data-driven, not hard-coded.

Deliver the complete repository with:
- `src/firebase.ts` containing the exact config above
- Full working code
- `firebase.json` and `.firebaserc` ready
- Exact deploy commands in README

Start coding now – make it perfect. This must work on the first deploy at https://workout-planner-b5bd6.web.app

GO.
