## Elite Warm-up Scheme (Main Lifts)
*Applied to Squat, Bench Press, and Deadlift in: Trinary, Pain & Glory, Ritual of Strength*

### General Warm-up (Before Barbell)
**For Bench Press:**
- Warm up rotator cuff, do some dynamic arching motion
- Light lat activation pump work (single arm banded lat prayer recommended)
- Single leg glute bridges with concentric hold for glute activation

**For Squat:**
- Hip swings, hip airplanes, cossack squats
- Banded good mornings, hamstring stretches
- Single leg glute bridges with concentric hold
- Ass-to-grass bodyweight squats

**For Deadlift:**
- Hip swings, hip airplanes
- Barbell/banded good mornings + stiff legged good mornings
- Bodyweight lunges/bulgarian split squats
- Light lat activation pump (single arm banded lat prayer recommended)
- Single leg glute bridges with concentric hold

### Barbell Warm-up Sets
*Static, grayed-out, non-logged sets displayed before working sets*

**Progression:**
1. **Empty Bar × 8-10** (fast touch-and-go, groove speed/pattern)
2. **50% × 5**
3. **70% × 3**
4. **85% × 2**
5. **95% × 1** (only on heavy/ME days; skip on volume/DE/light days to save energy)

**Rules:**
- All warm-up sets paused (1-sec pause at bottom/chest for bench/squat, brief pause off floor for deadlift)
- Total warm-up reps: ~19-21 max on heavy days
- Percentages calculated from the weight that will be used on the first working set
- Rounded down to nearest 2.5 kg

### Paused Bench Press Weight Calculation (January 2026 Overhaul)

> **IMPORTANT: Old onboarding jump system has been completely REMOVED.**
> All progress is now driven exclusively by AMRAP performance and phased thresholds.
> Rounding uses nearest 2.5 kg with safety cap for plate accuracy.

#### Base Weight (`pausedBench`) Calculation
*   **Starting Point:** User's onboarding 1RM value
*   **Progression Driver:** Saturday AMRAP tests with phased rep thresholds

#### AMRAP Progression (Saturday Test)
| Week Range | Rep Threshold | Effect |
|------------|---------------|--------|
| Weeks 1–6  | ≥12 reps      | +2.5 kg to base next week |
| Weeks 7–9  | ≥10 reps      | +2.5 kg to base next week |
| Weeks 10–12| ≥8 reps       | +2.5 kg to base next week |
| Below threshold | — | No increase (stall) |

#### e1RM Re-Calculation (Every 4 Weeks)
*   **Schedule:** End of Week 4, Week 8, Week 12
*   **Formula:** Epley Formula: `e1RM = AMRAP weight × (1 + reps/30)`
*   **New Base:** e1RM rounded **DOWN** to nearest 2.5 kg
*   **Display Message:** `"e1RM updated from AMRAP: X kg. Base reset for next block."`
*   **Example:** AMRAP 90 kg × 12 reps → e1RM = 90 × 1.4 = 126 kg → Base = 125 kg

#### Working Weight Calculation
| Day | Intensity | Percentage of Current Base |
|-----|-----------|---------------------------|
| Monday (Heavy) | 82.5% → 87.5% | Progressive across weeks |
| Wednesday (Volume) | 72.5% → 77.5% | Progressive across weeks |
| Thursday (Power) | 77.5% | Fixed explosive work |
| Saturday (AMRAP) | 67.5% | Test set |

**Rounding Rules (Day-Specific):**
1.  Calculate raw weight: `base × percentage`
2.  Apply rounding based on day type:
    *   **Monday (Heavy) & Thursday (Power):** Round to NEAREST 2.5 kg (conservative)
        *   Upward cap: Never round up more than +2.5 kg above raw value
        *   Example: raw 125.81 kg → nearest 125 kg (down 0.81 kg)
    *   **Wednesday (Volume) & Saturday (AMRAP):** Round UP to nearest 2.5 kg (ceiling)
        *   Ensures visible progression after successful AMRAPs
        *   Example: raw 125.81 kg → ceil 127.5 kg

#### Peaking Block (Weeks 13–15)
*   Uses final Week 12 re-calculated e1RM for all percentage calculations
*   Week 13: 90–92.5% Doubles + 75% AMRAP
*   Week 14: 95–97.5% Singles + 81% AMRAP
*   Week 15: 1RM Test Day (105% attempt)

#### Deload & Recovery System (January 2026 - Final Implementation)

**Core Philosophy: Strategic Recovery for Maximum Performance**

The program includes two mandatory deload weeks at critical points to optimize recovery and peak performance.

**WEEK 9: Mandatory Deload (Post-Base Building)**
*   **Position:** Always appears after Week 8 (extends program from 15 to 16 weeks)
*   **Structure:** Clones Week 8 exercises with automatic modifications:
    *   All exercises: -15% weight reduction (85% of normal weight)
    *   All exercises: Half volume (sets ÷ 2, minimum 1 set)
    *   Day names: "Monday Recovery", "Wednesday Light", "Saturday Technique", etc.
*   **Purpose:** Mandatory recovery after intense base-building phase (weeks 1-8)
*   **Display:** Blue "MANDATORY DELOAD" badge in Dashboard
*   **Base Weight:** No change to pausedBench base (maintains progression continuity)

**WEEK 13: Peaking Deload (Pre-Test Week)**
*   **Position:** After week 12, before final peaking/testing phase
*   **Structure:** Heavily reduced volume, bench-specific deload:
    *   **Monday:** Paused Bench ONLY (4x2 @ 91%), NO accessories, NO triceps
    *   **Tuesday:** Legs (maintenance)
    *   **Wednesday:** 
        *   Paused Bench: 2 sets @ 55.25% (3 sets → 2 sets, 65% → 55.25%)
        *   Weighted Pull-ups: 3 sets (unchanged)
        *   Deload note added: "[Week 13 Deload: -15% weight, half volume]"
    *   **Thursday:**
        *   BTN Press: 2 sets with -15% weight (if module enabled)
        *   NO tricep exercises
    *   **Friday:** Legs (maintenance)
    *   **Saturday:** CONDITIONAL test day (see below)
*   **Display:** Blue "MANDATORY DELOAD" badge
*   **Purpose:** Taper for peak performance, reduce fatigue before test

**Week 13 Saturday - Conditional Test Day:**
*   **Option A (Peaking Block):** AMRAP @ 80% + accessories → Continue to Weeks 14-16 peaking
*   **Option B (Test Now):** 1RM attempt @ 105% + accessories → End program after test
*   User chooses via post-Week 12 modal
*   Only the test exercise appears (no other benching accessories)

**1RM Test Warmup Protocol (Weeks 13 or 16):**
*   Special warmup percentages for max attempts:
    1. Empty bar × 8-10
    2. 50% × 5
    3. 70% × 3
    4. **80% × 2** (conservative double, prevents fatigue)
    5. **90% × 1** (potentiation single, not too close to max)
*   Compared to normal heavy days (85% double, 95% single)

**Deload Trigger Detection (Future Dynamic System):**
*   System tracks but doesn't currently insert dynamic deloads:
    1. **Forced tracker:** Logs Week 8 completion to Firebase
    2. **Reactive tracker:** Detects 2 consecutive AMRAPs ≤7 reps
    3. **Big drop tracker:** Monitors >15% e1RM drops at recalculation
*   Data saved for future enhancement: dynamic deload week insertion

**Final Program Structure:**
*   Weeks 1-8: Base building
*   Week 9: DELOAD (mandatory recovery)
*   Weeks 10-12: Final training block
*   Week 13: DELOAD (peaking taper)
*   Weeks 14-16: Peaking/Testing (if user chose Option A)
*   **Total Duration:** 16 weeks (with both deloads)

**Weighted Pull-ups Progression (Weeks 10-12):**
*   **Week 10 Wednesday:**
    *   Set 1: 1RM max effort test (record weight!)
    *   Sets 2-4: 2-3 reps @ 92.5% of new 1RM
    *   Rep display: "1, 2-3, 2-3, 2-3"
*   **Week 11-12 Wednesday:**
    *   All 4 sets: 2+ reps @ 92.5% of Week 10 max
    *   Focus on quality reps, beat Week 10 volume

### Bench Press Variations (Independent Progression)

#### Fixed Rep Target Exercises
*   **Spoto Press (5 reps):** Hit exact 5 reps on ALL sets → +2.5 kg next session
*   **Low Pin Press (4 reps):** Hit exact 4 reps on ALL sets → +2.5 kg next session
*   Message: *"Target reps hit – weight auto-increased +2.5 kg next time"*

#### Rep Range Exercises
*   **Wide-Grip Bench Press (6–8 reps):**
    *   Hit TOP of range (8 reps) on ALL sets for 2 consecutive weeks → +2.5 kg
    *   Message: *"Hit top reps on all sets for 2 straight weeks → +2.5 kg"*

*   **Smart Weighing:** System auto-detects if stored stat is 1RM (>85% of Bench) or Working Weight

### Behind-the-Neck Press
*   **Monday (Heavy):** Hit max reps (5) on all sets → +2.5 kg for NEXT week
*   **Thursday (Volume):** Auto-scaled to 85% of Monday's weight

### Weighted Pull-ups (EMOM Progression)
*   All weights in kilograms only (no lbs)
*   **Weeks 1-3:** Max reps EMOM until form breaks (add 2.5 kg plate)
*   **Weeks 4-6:** Fixed-weight EMOM (15-set cap, live total rep counter)
*   **Weeks 7-9:** Daily max triple + 6 back-offs @ 87.5% (7 sets total)
*   **Weeks 10-12:** Max single (Wed W10) → 5 sets @ 92.5% (W11-12)

### Progression Phases

#### Phase 1: Accumulation (Weeks 1-8)

**Pull Days:**
1.  **Deficit Snatch Grip Deadlift** (10 × 6)
    *   Starting weight: 45% of Conventional Deadlift 1RM
    *   Tip: "4 second eccentric, max 2 min rest. Do NOT cheat on eccentric."

**Second Pull Day (Friday):** Replace Deficit Snatch Grip with:
*   **Conventional Deadlift E2MOM** (6 sets × 3-5 reps)
    *   Starting weight = Highest Deficit Snatch Grip weight × 1.35
    *   **Auto progression:** All 6 sets hit 5 reps → +2.5 kg next week

**Push Days (Weeks 9-16):**
*   Squat weight FIXED at ~85-90% of Week 8 final weight
*   Maintain RPE 6-7, no weight progression

#### Phase 3: Peaking (Weeks 13-16)

**Week 13 - AMRAP Test:**
*   Weight = Week 12 Deficit Snatch Grip × 2.22 × 0.85
*   Calculate e1RM using Epley: `weight × (1 + reps/30)`

**Week 14 - Heavy Triple:** 1 × 3 @ 90% e1RM (RPE 9) + 3 × 3 back-down @ 85%

    *   All lifts remain but lighter
*   **Purpose:** Mandatory deload before starting a new cycle

#### Reactive Recovery Check (Weeks 8 & 12 Only)
*   **Trigger:** After completing the final workout of Weeks 8 and 12
*   **Modal:** "How was your recovery over the last 4 weeks? Rate 1-10 (10 = perfect)"
*   **Response Actions:**
    *   **If ≤6 (Poor Recovery):** INSERT a 1-week Purge Week NEXT, extending the program by 1 week
        *   User continues to scheduled Week 9 or Week 13 AFTER the deload
        *   Example: Week 8 → Recovery ≤6 → Purge Week → Week 9 → ... → Week 17 (instead of 16)
    *   **If >6 (Good Recovery):** Continue to next scheduled week (no deload inserted)
*   **Note:** No recovery check at Week 16 (auto-deload handles it)

### Re-Run Modal (After Final Workout - Week 16)

## 9. Super Mutant - Wasteland Adaptive Hypertrophy (`super-mutant`)
*Fallout-themed reactive training system - Your body adapts, the workout mutates.*

### Plan Configuration
*   **Duration:** 84 Workouts (~14 weeks at 6x/week)
*   **Frequency:** Fully Adaptive (2-7x/week based on recovery)
*   **Widgets:** `recovery_gauge` (muscle cooldowns + 7-day volume), `mutagen_exposure` (progress tracker)
*   **Theme:** Toxic green + radiation orange, Fallout wasteland aesthetic

### Core Philosophy
**Auto-Regulation Through Biological Feedback:**
- Muscles trained → 48h cooldown (upper) or 72h cooldown (lower)
- Volume tracked per muscle → Reactive set calculation
- Cluster-based training → Prevents overtraining
- Fractional set counting → Accurate volume tracking

### Onboarding
#### Exercise Variants Selection
User selects preferred variants:
*   **Chest:** Barbell Press / Dumbbell Press / Machine Press
*   **Back:** Wide Pulldowns / Neutral Pulldowns / Underhand Pulldowns  
*   **Hamstrings:** RDLs / Good Mornings / Lying Leg Curl
*   **Quads:** Hack Squat / Front Squat / Leg Press

### Training Clusters System

#### Fixed Muscle Group Clusters
**Cluster 1 (Chest/Triceps/Biceps):**
- 3 exercises: Pre-exhaust, Main, Finisher
- Estimated time: ~30 min
- Upper body push/pull

**Cluster 2 (Back/Shoulders/Calves):**
- 3 exercises for back + shoulders, calves
- Estimated time: ~30 min
- Upper body pull/accessory

**Cluster 3 (Hamstrings/Glutes/Lower Back):**
- 2-3 exercises for posterior chain
- Estimated time: ~20 min
- Lower body posterior

**Cluster 4 (Quads/Abductors/Abs):**
- 2-3 exercises for anterior chain + core
- Estimated time: ~20 min
- Lower body anterior

#### Cluster Exclusivity Rules
- **Cluster 1 cannot train with Cluster 2** (prevents over-training upper push + pull same day)
- **Cluster 3 cannot train with Cluster 4** (prevents over-training lower posterior + anterior same day)
- Valid combinations: Cluster 1 + Cluster 3/4, Cluster 2 + Cluster 3/4

### Workout Generation Logic

#### Cluster Selection Priority
1. **Check Readiness:** Only consider clusters where ALL muscles passed cooldown
2. **Sort by Oldest:** Prioritize clusters trained longest ago (maintains rotation order)
3. **Apply Exclusivity:** Skip incompatible clusters
4. **Select 2 Clusters:** Fit within 90-minute target session

#### Target Session Duration
- Default: 90 minutes
- Cluster 1/2: ~30 min each
- Cluster 3/4: ~20 min each
- Typical session: 2 clusters = 50-60 min actual work

### Reactive Sets Calculation

#### Volume-Based Adaptation
**Target:** ~20 sets per muscle per week

**Formula:**
```
Estimated Weekly Workouts = Recent Activity (2-6 workouts/week)
Estimated Muscle Workouts = Weekly Workouts / 2
Remaining Sets = 20 - Current 7-Day Volume
Sets Per Workout = Remaining Sets / Estimated Workouts
→ Constrained to 2-4 sets range
```

**Special Rules:**
- **Upper Body Muscles (Chest/Back/Shoulders/Triceps/Biceps):**
  - No volume → Start at 2sets
  - Volume-based adaptation
  
- **Lower Body Muscles (Hamstrings/Glutes/Lower Back/Abs/Abductors):**
  - No volume → Start at **4 sets** (limited exercises, unlikely to hit 20/week)
  - Still adapts based on volume

- **Pre-Exhaust/Finishers:** Always 2 sets (fixed)

### Fractional Set Counting

#### Upper Body Compounds
**Chest Presses (Bench, DB Press, Machine):**
- 1.0 → Chest (primary)
- 0.5 → Triceps
- 0.5 → Shoulders

**Chest Flyes/Pec Deck:**

- 0.5 → Shoulders

**Back Rows:**
- 1.0 → Back (primary)
- 0.5 → Biceps
- 0.5 → Shoulders

**Back Pulldowns/Pulls:**
- 1.0 → Back

- 1.0 → Quads (primary)
- 0.5 → Hamstrings
- 0.5 → Glutes
- 0.5 → Abductors

**RDLs/Good Mornings:**
- 1.0 → Hamstrings (primary)
- 0.5 → Glutes

#### Lower Body Isolation

## Super Mutant (`super-mutant`)
*Advanced 16-Week Fallout-Themed High-Frequency Hypertrophy Program*

###Duration & Structure
- **Total Duration:** 16 Weeks (Four 4-week cycles)
- **Deload Schedule:** Mandatory deload at Week 9 (after 2 cycles)
- **Frequency:** Dynamic 3-6 sessions/week based on recovery
- **Session Limit:** Auto-capped at 6 sessions/7 days

### RIR (Reps in Reserve) Progression
Progressive fatigue management across each 4-week cycle:

| Week in Cycle | RIR | Instruction |
|---------------|-----|-------------|
| Week 1 | 2 RIR | "Leave 2 reps in reserve" |
| Week 2 | 1 RIR | "Leave 1 rep in reserve" |
| Week 3 | 0 RIR | "Take to failure" |
| Week 4 | Past Failure | "Past failure – use intensification technique" |

**Note:** RIR instruction appears on EVERY exercise in workout view

### Intensification Techniques (Week 4 Only)
When RIR = -1 (past failure), exercises include technique-specific guides:

**Main Exercises (Compounds):**
```
REST-PAUSE: Reach failure, rest 10–15 sec, squeeze 3–5 more reps, repeat 2–3 times.
Tip: 'Failure, short breath rest, squeeze more reps – build the beast.'
```

**Pre-Exhaust Exercises (Isolation):**
```
DROPSET: Drop 20–30% weight 2–3 times till failure each drop.
Tip: 'Drop weight immediately after failure, no rest, repeat 2–3 times – chase the burn.'
```

**Finisher Exercises:**
```
MYO-REPS: Activation set to failure, then 3–5 mini-sets of 3–5 reps with 3–5 breaths rest.
Tip: 'Activation to failure, then mini-sets with short breaths – total exhaustion for growth.'
```

### Deload Week (Week 9)
**Parameters:**
- 50% sets (e.g., 4 sets → 2 sets)
- RIR 2-3 (leave reps in reserve)
- Single cluster selection
- Message: "DELOAD WEEK: Leave 2-3 reps in reserve, focus on form and recovery"

**Purpose:** Mandatory recovery after 8 intense weeks prevents burnout and optimizes long-term gains

### Alternating Block Queue System
**Structure:**
The program uses strict alternation between upper and lower training blocks:

**Upper Blocks (ALWAYS included, alternates every workout):**
- **Block A:** Chest / Triceps / Biceps (~30 min)
- **Block B:** Back / Shoulders / Calves (~30 min)

**Lower Blocks (added when ready, 72h cooldown):**
- **Block C:** Hamstrings / Glutes / Lower Back (~20 min)
- **Block D:** Quads / Abductors / Abs (~20 min)

**Selection Logic:**
1. **Upper:** ALWAYS include next upper block (A or B, alternates each workout)
2. **Lower:** Add next lower block (C or D, alternates) IF:
   - All muscles in block off 72h cooldown
   - Session time + 20min ≤ 90min cap
3. **Over-Volume Exclusion:** If assisting muscles >20 sets/7days:
   - **Block A:** Exclude Triceps and/or Biceps if over volume (keep Chest)
   - **Block B:** Exclude Shoulders if over volume (keep Back + Calves)
4. **Crank Logic:** If session <45min after base, increase primary exercise to 4 sets
5. **Short Session Warning:** If session <30min without lower, show "Short Mutation – Rest or Perish"

**Cooldown Periods:**
- Lower body muscles: **72 hours** (hamstrings, glutes, lowerBack, quads, abductors, abs)
- Upper body trains every workout via alternation (no cooldown check needed)

**Session Caps:**
- **Time:** Max 90 minutes per session
- **Weekly:** If >6 sessions in 7 days: "Over-mutation risk – rest or perish? Yes/No"

**Examples:**
- **Workout 1:** Block A (Chest/Tri/Bi) + Block C (Hams/Glutes/LBack) if ready → 50min
- **Workout 2:** Block B (Back/Shoulders/Calves) + Block D (Quads/Abs) if ready → 50min
- **Workout 3:** Block A (Chest/Tri/Bi), no lower ready → 30min
- **Over-volume:** Block A with Triceps excluded (>20 sets), Chest cranked to 4 sets → 45min

### Reactive Volume System
**Target:** ~20 sets per muscle per week

**Set Calculation:**
- Estimates weekly training frequency
- Distributes sets to reach 20-set target
- Range: 2-4 sets per exercise
- Lower body starts at 4 sets (limited exercise pool)

**Example:**
- Chest at 12 sets/7days, 3 workouts remaining → 3 sets per workout
- Hamstrings at 4 sets/7days, 2 workouts remaining → 4 sets per workout

### Exercise Pool
**Chest (Alternating A/B):**
- Variant A: Pec Deck → Incline DB Bench → Deficit Pushups
- Variant B: Mid Cable Flyes → Hammer Chest Press → Deficit Pushups

**Back (Alternating A/B):**
- Variant A: Hammer Underhand Pulldown + Single Arm Cable Row + Lat Prayer
- Variant B: Rope Cable Row + Lat Pulldown (Mid Grip) + Single Arm Hammer Row

**Shoulders:** Lying Cable Lat Raises + Single Arm Reverse Pec Deck + Lateral Raises

**Triceps:** Triangle Pushdown + EZ Skullcrushers + Single Arm Overhead Extension

**Biceps:** Incline DB Curls + EZ Preacher Curl + Hammer Curls

**Hamstrings (Choice):** Seated Ham Curl + [Good Mornings OR Deficit RDLs] + Single Leg Hip Thrust

**Quads (Choice):** Leg Extensions + [Hack Squat OR Front Squat] + Hip Adduction

**Remaining:** Standing Calf Raises, Cable Crunches

### Rep Ranges by Cycle
| Cycle | Weeks | Rep Ranges |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 1-2 | 1-8 | 8-12 (main), 10-15 (isolation) |
| 3-4 | 9-16 | 10-15 (main), 15-20 (isolation) |

### Program Completion & Re-Run
**At 16 Week Completion (112 workouts):**
```
Modal: "The mutation is incomplete. Continue?"

Option 1: "Yes – Begin Next Cycle"
- Mandatory deload week
- All weights migrate with +2.5-5kg increase
- Message: "Weights increased by X kg. The mutation continues..."
- currentCycle resets to 1

Option 2: "No – Complete Program"
- End program
- Suggest next program options
```

### Progression Logic
**Weight Increases:**
- Cycle transitions (1→2, 3→4): +2.5-5kg on all exercises
- Re-run: +2.5-5kg migration

**Volume Tracking:**
- 7-day rolling window
- Resets on cycle transitions
- Fractional counting for assisting muscles

### Dashboard Widgets
- **Mutagen Exposure:** Progress tracker (X/112 workouts)
- **Recovery Gauge:** 12 muscle groups with cooldown timers + volume
- **Mutant Mindset:** Rotating quotes
- **Workout History:** Session log

### ✅ Implementation Status (February 2026)
